# Create a chess board which highlights the squares being attacked by a bishop.

Display a chessboard on your webpage. Below is an example of what a chessboard looks like.

When the user hovers on any square of the chessboard:

- Change the color of the square to light blue.
- Change the color of the squares that would be attacked by a bishop to dark blue. A bishop attacks along its [diagonals](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)#Placement_and_movement>).

An example of hover state is shown below.
